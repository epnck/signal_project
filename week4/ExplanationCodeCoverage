With the unit tests the only lines not covered are in the EcgMonitor when the number of records surpasses the window size.
Since the window size is currently set to 60, and test cases only have a length of 3, the lines adjusting the window are not tested.
Additionally, not all possible cases of the blood pressure increase and decrease trend are tested, 6 out of 8 cases are tested.
These tests should be implemented in the future to further test the reliability of the code.
